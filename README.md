# It is meal time now!👋
 
 This playground aims to give a foundational understanding of nutrition to children and teenager. Thus, encouraged them to have a healthy combination of food in every meal.
 
 
 ## Your Online Nutritionist Friend 🤓🍔
 
 As a gentle introduction about nutrition, this playground introduce a friend that knows a lot about nutrition to children. From my observation, children is more engaged in game-like activities and thus remember information introduced in the game more.
 

# It is now time to choose your food 😋
 
 This page aim to give a brief evaluation of chosen food for a meal. It allows drag-drop food from the top to the plate area in the middle, and evaluate the food after hitting the "Check" button. Have fun and test out your favorite meal!
 
 * Callout(Tip💡):
 If you find trouble with drag-and-drop, click the food emoji, hold for 0.1s, drag into the plate area, find a spacy area to drop your food, the food should have a green + sign on the top left now, then drop it.
